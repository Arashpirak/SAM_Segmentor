Sam_segmentor
Sam_segmentor is a simple code example to demonstrate how Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) can be used to detect and visualize objects in images. Using a basic PyQt5 interface, this code allows you to select a folder of images and view the segmentation results generated by SAM.

Features:
Simple Interface: Select image folders and view segmentation results with ease.
Demonstrates SAM Capabilities: Provides a straightforward way to see how SAM can segment objects in images.
Limitations:
While SAM is powerful, it can be slow when processing large images or multiple files, which is a known drawback of the model.

Getting Started:
Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/Arashpirak/SAM_Segmentor
Install SAM: Follow the instructions at Segment Anything GitHub(https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) to install the SAM model.
Install Other Dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Code: python Sam_segmentor.py
